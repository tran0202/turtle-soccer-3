      "The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the FIFA. The championship has been awarded every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946. The current champion is France, which won its second title in Russia 2018.",
      "The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month.",
      "The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each."

Teams participating in the preliminary and final competitions must be composed of U-23 players, with up to three players who are at least 23."
